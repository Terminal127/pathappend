# Path Append Script

This Python script uses the `path.py` library to append paths. It allows you to easily combine a base path with a subfolder path to create a new path.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Install the `path.py` library if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Terminal127/pathappend
   cd Pathappend
   ./path.py
